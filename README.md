## Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹
A/B testing (also known as bucket testing, split-run testing, or split testing) is a user experience research methodology. A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment that usually involves two variants (A and B). However, A/B Testing is very important to determine the difference between two variants. Currently, AB testing is very required by every industry, I have tried to do A/B Testing using python and created the result of A/B testing using Google Slides. I was so curious to learn about these, which were a bit difficult. Anyway, it's fine. So I would like to show you about Campaign AB testing using python and the report of Campaign AB testing by Google Slides.
